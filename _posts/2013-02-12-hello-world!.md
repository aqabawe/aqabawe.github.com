After fiddling with Blogger.com for a couple of hours, I discovered <a href='http://pages.github.com'>Github pages</a>! Oh the joy, will make a detailed post on Github pages and <a href='https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll'>Jekyll</a> when I feel that I got the hang of it. This blog is open sourced, you can find everything <a href='https://github.com/aqabawe/aqabawe.github.com'>here</a>

In addition to being my personal blog, <a href='http://www.rubybites.com'>RubyBites.com</a> directs here. This is my mini blog about Ruby, Rails and everything web. Stay tuned.
